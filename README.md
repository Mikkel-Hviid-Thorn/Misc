# Simulations

Different simulations and visualisation. Right now only one simulation is made based on traffic in an airport. The file 'Lufthavns_simulation_module' includes all the code for the simulation, while 'Lufthavns_data_plots' plots the result of the same simulation.

The simulation is based on the course 'Programmering for matematikere'.
